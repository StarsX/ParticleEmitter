# ParticleEmitter
An improved implementation of my CASA 2013 paper "Real‐time generation of smoothed‐particle hydrodynamics‐based special effects in character animation" (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cav.1545). Particle emissions from the surface of mesh. The emitters are approximatively uniformly distributed by taking the advantage of quad tessellations. The fluid is simulated by SPH using my prefix-sum bin sorting.
